This document discusses the identification of antiviral drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2 from FDA-approved drugs. The authors believe that drug repositioning is the only feasible option to address the COVID-19 global challenge. They screened a panel of 48 FDA-approved drugs against SARS-Co V and identified 24 potential antiviral drug candidates. The authors found that some drug candidates showed very low 50% in-hibitory concentrations (IC50s), and in particular, two FDA-approved drugs, niclos-amide and ciclesonide, were notable in some respects.
This study evaluated 48 FDA-approved drugs against SARS-CoV-2 infection and revealed 24 potential antiviral drug candidates against SARS-Co V-2. The study also tested the antiviral activity of several other drugs based on the cytopathic effect of the virus in the presence of each drug. The effects of favipiravir and atazanavir were compared with those of the reference drugs, but they did not show any antiviral activity. The results of the study could be further validated in an appropriate animal model and, hopefully, developed through subsequent clinical trials in order to provide additional therapeutic options for patients with COVID-19.
This document is a collection of articles on antiviral drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2. It includes articles on the use of rilpivirine and chloroquine to inhibit the novel coronavirus in vitro, and studies on the use of niclosamide to inhibit the coronavirus in vitro. It also includes articles on the absorption of pyrviniumpamoate, ciclesonide, and the potential of ciclesonide inhalation for COVID-19 pneumonia.

This article explores the role of phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) on viable sperm and phagocytic machinery in oocytes in mammalian fertilization. It is shown that Phosphatidylserine(PtdSer ) is exposed on the head region of viable and motile sperm, with PtdSer exposure progressively increasing during sperm transit through the epididymis. Functionally, masking phosphatidylsamine on sperm via three different approaches inhibits fertilization. On the oocyte, phosphatidylsyne recognition receptors BAI1, CD36, Tim-4, and Mer-TK contribute to fertilization. Additionally, the signaling pathway ELMO1/RAC1, downstream of the PtdSerreceptors BAI1/3, and the fusion of mammalian sperm with skeletal myoblasts require PtdSer on sperm and BAI1/2, ELMO2, RAC1 in myoblasts. These results shed light into the molecular mechanism of sperm:egg fusion.
This document discusses the role of recognition of PtdSer on sperm in in vitro fertilization. It also discusses the role of PtdSer receptors on oocytes, which may contribute to sperm:egg fusion. The study used the binding of fluorescently labeled 2 m carboxylate modied beads to test whether the surface of oocytes contains potential PtdSer-binding molecules. It also found that the expression of BAI family members and CD36 was readily detected in both mouse and human oocytes. The study also tested the effect of antibodies targeting CD36 and BAI1/3 on sperm entry into the oocyte, and found that blocking three of the ve PtdSer receptors expressed on oocytes can also inhibit fertilization in vitro. Finally, the study genetically tested the contribution of oocytePtdSer receptors to fertilization, and found that mice decient in Tim-4, BAI1, and Mer-TK showed a modest but statistically signicant reduction in the percentage of fertilized eggs.
This document discusses the effects of PtdSer on fertilization in in vitro fertilization with decient oocytes. It also discusses the role of the BAI1/3-ELMO1-Rac1 signaling axis in fertilization and the role of the ELMORAC1 signaling module downstream of BAI1/2. It also discusses how PtdSer exposure on skeletal myoblasts is important for the fusion between myoblasts to form myotubes and whether this fusion is mediated by the BAI1-ELMO1, RAC1, and Juno module expressed by myoblasts. It also discusses three additional approaches to address the fusion between sperm and skeletal myoblasts.
This study provides insights into sperm:egg fusion during mammalian fertilization. The heads of viable and motile sperm display PtdSer, which is essential for intracellular signaling events. Blocking PtdSer on the sperm and its interaction via the BAI1-ELMORAC1 module on the myoblast can contribute to cell:cell fusion, in a Juno-independent manner. The study also found that C2C12 myoblasts are easier to manipulate and genetically modify than oocytes, and may provide a good system to probe the mechanistic aspects of sperm fusion. The study also acknowledges a limitation of the study, as genetic deletion of PtdSer is extremely hard to meet in our study, and the technical issue of genetically manipulating PtdSer exposure and its recognition remains to be tackled in the future.
This document discusses the role of PtdSer on sperm and its receptors on oocytes in mediating sperm binding to oocytes and fusion. It proposes that Izumo1 and PtdSer on Sperm could function cooperatively in mediating sperm binding and fusion. The study also proposes multimeric interactions between the sperm and egg surfaces for achieving specicity and avidity. The study also provides genetic testing of PtdSer receptors and cytoplasmic signaling in oocytes. The study also used C57BL/6 mice and Dx4-Cre mice to test the effects of RAC1 inhibition on sperm motility. The study also included experiments to visualize sperm motility and to detect PtdSer. The results suggest that PtdSer onsperm and its receptors on oocyte can work in conjunction with Izumo1, Juno, and other molecules to promote sperm:egg fusion during fertilization.
This document describes the methods used to perform IVF assays, sperm staining, sperm motility, and sperm DNA decondensation assays. It also describes the role of PtdSer and the BAI3-ELMO2-RAC1 signaling axis in fertilization assays, and the staining of mouse/human eggs with antibodies. The results of these experiments are presented in the appendix of the document.
This study aims to investigate the role of the immunoglobulin superfamily protein Izumo in sperm-egg fusion. The study was approved by the Reproductive Medicine and Surgery Center of Virginia Institutional Review Board and used unfertilized human oocytes from female IVF patients undergoing treatment. The study evaluated the presence of functional PtdSer receptors on mouse ZP-free wild-type oocytes by incubating with 2 m carboxylate modied red beads for 2 h in TYH + BSA at 37 C, 5% CO2. The percentage of oocytes with bound beads was determined by microscopy. The study also involved the use of mouse ovaries and human ovaries to stain with BAI1/3, CD36, and CD9 antibodies, and the study used C2C12 murine skeletal muscle myoblasts to detect YFP sperm within myoblasts. The study also used quantitative RT-PCR to detect YFP in myoblasts and to determine the significance of statistical results.
This document is a collection of studies on the role of various G protein-coupled receptors in the fertilization process, including the role of phosphatidylserine, CD36, and CD9 in the fusion of myoblasts and myotubes. It also includes a review of the role of phosphoatidylserine in the regulation of cell death and cell migration. It also includes references to previous studies on the role and role of phospho atidylserine in cell death and cell death in the neighbourhood of the cell.

The COVID-19 cytokine storm: the interplay between inflammation and coagulation is discussed. The overproduction of early response proinflammatory cyto-kines (tumour necrosis factor [TNF], IL-6, and IL-1) results in a cytokine storm, leading to an increased risk of vascular hyperpermeability, multiorgan failure, and eventually death when the high cytokine concentrations are unabated over time. The activation of coagulation pathways during the immune response to infection results in overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines leading to multiorgan injury. The main function of thrombin is to promote clot formation by activating platelets and by converting fibrinogen to fibrin, but thrombin also exerts multiple cellular effects and can further augment inflammation via proteinase-activated receptors (PARs), principally PAR-1. The finding of increased d-dimer levels in patients with COVID-19 has prompted questions regarding co-existence of venous thromboembolism exacerbating ventilationperfusion mismatch, and some studies have shown that pulmonary emboli are prevalent. The role of PAR-1 antagonists and other coagulation protease inhibitors is also discussed.
The study suggests that targeting thrombin, coagulation factor Xa, or PAR-1 could be an attractive approach to reduce SARS-CoV-2 microthrombosis, lung injury, and associated poor outcomes. The study was conducted by Ricardo J Jose, Ari Manuel, and their research was published in J Thrombo Haemost 2020; 18; 84447. The study found that abnormal coagulation parameters are associated with poor prognosis in patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia. The authors declare no competing interests.

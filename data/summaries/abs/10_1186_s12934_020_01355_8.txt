This article discusses the functional expression of polyethylene terephthalate-degrading enzyme (PETase) in green algae. The author(s) of the article are Ji Won Kim, SuBin Park, and HeeSik Kim. The study focuses on the use of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a unicellular, photoautotrophic microorganism, as a model organism for the production of PETase. The expression of PETase was confirmed by western blotting and the activity of PETase was demonstrated through high-performance liquid chromatography and scanning electron microscopy.

This study demonstrates the functional expression of PETase in a model green microalga, C. reinhardtii, and its catalytic activity against a commercial PET bottle. The degradation of PETase from C. reinhardtii was much faster than that of the PETase produced from P. tricornutum, which was used as an alternative host. The results suggest that algae are a potential biological treatment strategy for plastic pollution, especially in freshwater and terrestrial environments.
This study aims to provide a standard for bio-logical degradation of plastics using green algae or other photosynthetic eukaryotes. The methods used include plasmid construction, strains, cell cultivation, and gene cloning. The PETase gene was reverse-translated, codon-optimized for C. reinhardtii, and cloned into pBR9_mCherry_Cre. The final clones were confirmed by PCR and DNA sequencing. The PETase expression was analyzed using SDS-PAGE and western blots. The catalytic activity of PETase was analyzed by using a commercial PET beverage bottle as the substrate. The results were analyzed using HPLC and HPLC-SEM techniques.

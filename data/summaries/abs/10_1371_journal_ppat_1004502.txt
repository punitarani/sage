This study investigates the entry of coronaviruses (CoVs) into host cells through the endo-/lysosomal pathway. Using siRNA gene silencing, the authors found that proteins known to be important for late endosomal maturation and endosome-lysosome fusion profoundly promote infection of cells with mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV). The results indicate that entry of MHV depends on proteolytic processing of its fusion protein S by lysosomal proteases. The authors conclude that a proteolytic cleavage site in the CoV S protein directly upstream of the fusion peptide is anessential determinant of the intracellular site of fusion.
This study investigates the entry of different coronaviruses (CoVs) into cells. Using siRNA gene silencing, it was found that murine hepatitis virus (MHV) enters cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis and relies on trafficking to lysosomes for proteolytic cleavage of its spike (S) protein and membrane fusion to occur. The study also found that MERS- and human CoVs require cleavage by different proteases and escape the endo/lysosomal system from differentcompartments. The study provides insight into the entry pathway of MHV and demonstrates that a proteolyticcleavage site in the S protein of different CoVs is an essential determinant of the intracellular site of fusion.
The study focuses on the role of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and endosome maturation in the entry step of the MHV infection cycle. The study also examines the effect of inhibitors on MHV infection by treating cells with endocytosis-affecting agents for 30 min and then infecting them with luciferase-expressing MHV. The results indicate that clathrin- and endosome-to-lysosome maturation is required for MHV entry and fusion. The study also analyzes the effect of RNAi-mediated gene silencing on fusion by using a fusion assay based on minimal complementation of defective b-galactosidase with the short a-peptide. The results of the fusion assay confirm the importance of clathrin and endosome maturation for MHV entry. Live-cell confocal microscopy confirms the co-localization, co-tracking, and fusion of MHV in endosomal compartments.
This document describes a study of the entry of a coronavirus into a cell through an endosomal pathway. It shows that MHV particles co-localize with all three endosomal compartments and that most virions fuse in late endosomes or lysosomes. The study also examines the effect of low pH in the endosomal system on MHV entry. The study shows that MHV is much less affected by perturbation of the endosomal pH than VSV and IAV, but still shows that late endosome-to-lysosome maturation is required for efficient entry. The study also shows that MHV infection depends on endosomal maturation.
The study focuses on the effects of various protease inhibitors on the entry of MHV into lysosomes. The study found that inhibition of a broad range of endosomal proteases efficiently blocks MHV fusion, indicating that efficient entry requires the activity of lysosomal proteases. The study also found that introduction of a furin cleavage site immediately upstream of the fusion peptide abolishes the requirement for trafficking of virions to lysosomes and for processing by lysosomal proteases. This results in the virus, which still depends on clathrin-mediated endocytosis, now requiring furin cleavage for efficient entry, the enzymes for which occur earlier in the endocytic pathway. The study also examined the effect of RNAi-mediated downregulation of early and late endosome and HOPS complex associated genes on MHV-S29FCS entry requirements.
This study provides an explanation for several conflicting results from earlier studies with respect to the process of MHV cell entry, particularly regarding thenecessity of proteolytic cleavage of the CoV S protein. By using areplication-independent fusion assay, we confirmed that MHV entry requires clathrin-mediated endocytosis despite the S protein's ability to induce cell-cell fusion at neutral pH. Efficient inhibition of MHV entry was only observed using a pan-lysosomal protease inhibitor, and could not be achieved using more specific protease inhibitors. The cleavage site immediately upstream of the FP is an essential determinant of the intracellular site of CoV fusion. The importance of clathrin-based endocytosis and endoso-mal trafficking in the entry of MHV was revealed by several complementary approaches, including siRNA-mediated gene silencing, recombinantviruses differing only in their spike proteins, and haploid knockout cells.
The ability of MHV to cause cell-cell fusion at neutral pH while requiring endocytic uptake for virus-cell fusion suggests different requirements and triggers for these two fusion processes. The present study confirms and extends previous publications on MHV entry via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and shows that clathrin-dependent entry of MHV strain A59 depends on clathrin-adaptor DAB2, but not on EPS15 or AAK1. The importance of early endosomes for entry was confirmed by using knockout cells lacking a functional HOPS complex. MERS-CoV requires cleavage by furin but not bylysosomal proteases for infection, but is inhibited by furin inhibitor (FI) but not by the pan-lysosomal protease inhibitor (CPI). The sequence immediately upstream of the F protein is a key determinant of the intracellularsite of fusion, and cleavage of the S protein immediately upstream of the FP is essential for CoV entry and determines the intracellular site of fusion.
This document describes the study of the entry of SARS-CoV and IBV into human cells using recombinant MHV and FIPV viruses. It also describes the use of a modified version of the MLV retroviral vector to generate stable cell lines and the generation of recombinant/pseudo viruses using targeted RNA recombination. The study also describes the preparation of the reagents used in the experiments and the use of stock stock of various drugs. The study concludes that cleavage at the FP proximal position is likely to be a general requirement for CoV entry, with the exception of IBV, and that cleavage of the fusion protein upon endocytosis is an important determinant of the intracellular site of fusion. The study also discusses the question of why some CoVs evolved to fuse in early endosomal vesicles while others require trafficking to lysosomes.
This document describes the methods used to determine the effects of siRNA knockdowns on the expression of various genes. The methods used to determine virus infections, luciferase expression, fluorescence microscopy, and fusion assay using b-galactosidase complementation are described. The sequences of MHV-A59 and MHV-S29FCS were aligned using MegAlign and confirmed of the knockdown of the gene "RAP7A" using a co-transfected HeLa cell. The methods used for sequence alignment and confirmation of the knockdown of this gene are also described.
This document describes the experiments used to investigate the role of the coronavirus in the cell fusion process. The experiments were carried out using Oligofectamine, a Life Technologies reagent, and the mRFP-RAB7A plasmid. The experiments involved the transfection of three independent, non-overlapping, non-overlapping RNAi siRNAs into target cells, the immunocytochemistry of HAP1 cells, western blotting, and immunofluorescence analysis of HAP1 cell cultures. The authors of the experiments were CB MHV BLH LP PJMR BJBCAMdH, who designed the experiments, performed the experiments, analyzed the data, contributed reagents/materials/analysis tools, and wrote the paper. The authors also thanked Dr. Thijn Brummelkamp, Dr. Susan Weiss, and Dr. Tom Gallagher for providing the necessary materials and scientific input.
